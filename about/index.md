Hi, I am bSpence. I am a senior security analyst for an unnamed fortune 500 company. After almost a decade working in the military and another in the private sector, this is my attempt to catalog my exploits. I'm not a professional blogger, but I am an aspiring ethical hacker who wants to contribute to the security community.. So sit back, relax, and lets n0ob out.

## What you will find here
